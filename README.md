## Info
Name: ***Save Ukraine***

Backstory:
```
Russias invading ukraine!
You Commander are the last hope we have to stop the beging of the third **World War**.

The Plan:
The Russian troops have only one way to enter the city. a single path connecting the outskirts
to the city center. You cannot let that happen. You are give all the items needed for turrents
but the only way to make them is with money. Money you will only get by showing the world you can win!
with each kill you will get some money. the more money you get, the more turrents you can build to stop the
